                Related data fields will let you connect a collection of data to another in one-to-one or one-to-many relationships. If you update a record in one place, it is instantly reflected everywhere else in your workspace.

                Every data type has its own interface to edit. Fields can be grouped into different layouts and re-arranged in a drag and drop interface.

                A database is nothing without the ability to search. Search on any combination of fields by entering your search query right in the interface.
